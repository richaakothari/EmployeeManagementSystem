# Employee Management System

A secure, full-stack web application for managing employee data with robust authentication, full CRUD operations, and a responsive React UI. It streamlines onboarding, record maintenance, and administrative workflows while enforcing best practices for security and data integrity.

## Key Features

- Secure Authentication
  - User registration and login
  - Password hashing with bcrypt
  - JWT-based stateless sessions
  - Password reset via email with expiring tokens

- Employee Management
  - Create, read, update, and delete employee records
  - Real-time list updates for a smooth UX
  - Client- and server-side validation with clear feedback

- Protected Routes
  - Auth-only access for sensitive operations
  - Frontend route guards with token validation

- Responsive UI
  - Clean, modern design with React
  - Mobile-friendly layout and components

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js, React Router DOM, Axios
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, JWT, bcrypt, Nodemailer
- Database: MongoDB (or MySQL)
- Tooling: dotenv (env vars), CORS (API communication), Postman (API testing)

## Project Structure


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS), npm or yarn
- MongoDB (or MySQL) running locally or in the cloud
- SMTP credentials for password reset emails (e.g., Mailtrap, SendGrid)

### Clone and Install

### Environment Variables

Create `.env` files using the examples below.

Server `.env.example`:

Client `.env.example` (Vite):

## API Overview

- Auth
  - POST /api/auth/register — create a new user (unique email)
  - POST /api/auth/login — authenticate and receive a JWT
  - POST /api/auth/forgot-password — send reset link/token
  - POST /api/auth/reset-password — verify token and set new password

- Employees
  - GET /api/employees — list with pagination/search/sort (optional)
  - POST /api/employees — create new employee
  - GET /api/employees/:id — get employee by ID
  - PUT /api/employees/:id — update employee
  - DELETE /api/employees/:id — delete employee (soft/hard configurable)

## Security

- bcrypt for password hashing (no plaintext storage)
- JWT for stateless auth (short-lived access token, optional refresh)
- CORS restricted to known origins via configuration
- Input validation and centralized error handling
- Helmet, rate limiting, and secure cookies recommended in production

## Validation and UX

- Form-level and field-level validation with inline errors
- Loading, empty, and error states for lists and details
- Optimistic updates with rollback on failure (optional)

## Database Notes

- MongoDB: Mongoose models with indexes for email and searchable fields
- MySQL: Equivalent schema via an ORM/repository pattern to keep parity

## Testing

- Backend: unit tests for services/controllers, integration tests for routes
- Frontend: component tests and route flow smoke tests
- Use a test database or containers (e.g., Testcontainers) for isolation

## Deployment

- Docker: multi-stage builds for server and client; serve client via Nginx
- CI/CD: lint, test, build, and deploy; inject secrets via environment
- Production hardening: TLS, Helmet, rate limiting, secure cookies, robust logging

## Roadmap

- Role-based access control (admin/manager/staff)
- Audit logs for employee data changes
- Bulk import/export (CSV/XLSX)
- Activity feed and notifications
- Advanced search and custom fields

## Contributing

- Use feature branches and conventional commits
- Open PRs with tests and pass CI before review
- Follow established linting/formatting rules

Choose and include a license (e.g., MIT) in the repository root.
